# Cook Eat Recipes!

A simple, recipe database for everyone, based on [http://chowdown.io](http://chowdown.io)

# Writing a Recipe

The recipes are stored in the collection "Recipes" (the folder /_recipes).

They are written in Markdown and contain a few special sections:

- The frontmatter, which contains:
 - Title, Image, and Layout (which is "recipe")
 - Ingredients (a list of things in the dish)
 - Directions (a list of steps for the dish)
- Body content (for intros, stories, written detail)
