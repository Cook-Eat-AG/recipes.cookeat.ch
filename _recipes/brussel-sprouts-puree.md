ingredients:
- 400 g brussels sprouts (fresh or frozen)
- 40 g vegan butter
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Pinch of sea salt

directions:
- Rinse the brussels sprouts (if frozen, allow to defrost beforehand in cold water). 
- Boil a pot of lightly salted water. Cut the brussels sprouts into quarters and blanch for about 2 minutes until they are tender, but not overcooked.
- Put the still hot brussels sprouts directly in a blender and puree them with cold butter, sea salt, pepper, honey and lemon juice.

The purée can be served hot or cold with a nice steak or roast, or even something like salmon. This could be a great side for Thanksgiving or any other holiday.
