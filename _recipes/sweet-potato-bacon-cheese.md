ingredients:
- 600-700 g sweet potato (2 potatoes)
- 50 g of bacon, in cubes
- 350 ml of sour cream or creme fraiche
- 1 small bundle of chives
- 2 cups of orange cheddar cheese
- Mexican spices to taste (paprika powder, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin powder, onion powder, salt, pepper)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 180C.
- Wash the sweet potato, cut off the ends and cut it into roughly 0.5 cm thick slices. Place all slices in a bowl and add some olive oil, mexican spice mix, salt and pepper. Place the slices flat on a baking tray with baking paper. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the skin crinkles around the sides and the middle is firm but soft with a fork.
- While the sweet potato is cooking, take a frying pan and on high heat, fry the bacon bits. After they are crispy, strain them in a sieve and place back in the pan to keep warm. Set aside. 
- Chop the chives finely.
- When the sweet potatoes are cooked, sprinkle Â½ the cheese over the sweet potato and place back in the oven for 2-3 minutes.
- Finally, divide the sweet potatoes into two bowls. Divide the bacon evenly between both. Top with the the sour cream/creme fraiche and sprinkle with chives.
