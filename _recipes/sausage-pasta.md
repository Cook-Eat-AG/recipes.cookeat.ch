ingredients:
- 300 g pasta (fusilli, penne, rigatoni)
- 2 large pork sausages
- 150 g fresh spinach
- 1 large jar/can of tomato sauce
- 1 small onion
- 2 tbsp tomato paste (concentrate)
- 500 ml vegetable bouillon
- 2 cups grated parmesan
directions:
- Preheat oven to 200C with bottom and top heat (not convection).
- In a separate smaller pot, cook the pasta according to instructions, making sure to only salt the water slightly.
- Finely chop the onion into 0.5 cm pieces. Wash the spinach in a strainer.
- Cut into the sausages slightly 3-4 times (so they don't explode) before placing in a baking dish or tray with paper. Bake in the oven around 12 minutes, until crispy on the top.
- In a large pot on medium high, heat some olive oil and then cook the onions for around 2-3 minutes, until glassy. Add the tomato paste and cook for another minute. Mix in the tomato sauce and reduce the heat to medium.
- When the pasta is cooked, take 1-2 tbsp of pasta water and add to the tomato sauce. Strain the pasta and add it to the tomato sauce. Add 1 cup of parmesan and stir.
- Remove the sausages from the oven, chop them into 1 cm thick slices. Add to the pasta and sauce pot. Mix well.
- Shortly before serving, mix in a handful of spinach at a time. Mix well before adding the next handful. Top with rest of parmesan on the plate.
