ingredients:
- 2 tbsp butter
- ⅓ cup orzo
- 1 cup white rice
- 6 cups vegetable broth
- ⅓ cup plus 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 carrots, peeled and cut into 0.5 cm cubes
- 2 cups fresh or thawed frozen organic peas
- 1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
- ½ cup fresh mint leaves
- ⅓ cup grated parmesan cheese
- 3 tablespoons pine nuts (optionally toasted)
directions:
- In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the orzo and toast until deep golden and fragrant. Stir in the rice, add about 2 cups stock and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally and adding a bit more stock if the rice begins to stick, until the rice is just tender, about 18 minutes.
- Meanwhile, in a soup pot, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the carrots; season with salt ad pepper. Cook stirring, until softened, 5-6 minutes. Add the remaining stock and the fresh peas (if using frozen, stir in just before serving). Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer.
- Using a food processor mix the parsley, mint, cheese, pine nuts and about ¼ cup olive oil into a pesto. Stream in more olive oil if needed. Stir the pesto into the rice pilaf.
- Serve ½ cup of the prepared rice in each of the soup bowls. Top with the peas and carrots in broth. Stir to combine.
