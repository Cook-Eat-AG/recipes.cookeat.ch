ingredients:
- 200 g potatoes
- 1 large carrot
- 50 g broccoli
- 200 g celery root
- 100 ml milk
- 50 g butter
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- (optional) vegetable broth

directions:
- Boil a large pot of lightly-salted water or alternatively, vegetable broth.
- While bringing to a boil, peel the potatoes and chop all the vegetables into 1-2 cm sized pieces. 
- Pour all the vegetables into the pot, keep boiling for around 15-20 minutes, until the celery root can be easily pierced with a fork.
- Strain all the vegetables, keeping some of the liquid if you want to use it for a broth later.
- If you have a blender - place all the vegetables in a blender, add the nutmeg, milk, butter and a good amount of pepper and mix on high until smooth and consistent.
- If you **don't** have a blender - place the pot back on the stove on low heat and return the vegetables to the pot. Add nutmeg, milk, butter and a good amount of pepper and use a utensil (such as a ladle) to mush the vegetables until it's as combined as possible.
- Serve with a good sausage or other type of meat, or eat it "pure" with a sprinkle of sea salt.

A true classic "Matty" dish that can use all different kinds of vegetables, whatever you have in your cupboard/fridge. You can easily make a big batch and freeze it for later! Be careful - it tends to come out brown no matter what you put in it; green/blue food colouring is your friend :D
